<h1 align="center">Professional README.md Generator</h1>

## Description

This is a Node.js application that takes in user input from inquirer prompts in the command line to generate a README.md file for the user's repository.

## Installation

The user should clone the repository from GitHub and install Node.

This application also imports and uses the file system and inquirer modules.

## Usage

In the command line, enter `node index` and press enter to run the application.

Using the command line, answer questions about the project to create a README.md file. Once all prompts are answered, a README.md file will be created in the './instructions' directory.
